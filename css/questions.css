/*
    Q3 - What CSS property are you having the most trouble figuring out?
*/
/* Float is the property that is hardest for me to figure out. It is not hard as a concept, but it always seems to find a way to break or behave in a strange way. 
Float is the Loki of the CSS code, a trickster that can find a way to break functional code in completely unexpected ways.



*/

/*
    Q4 - What is the best CSS property and why?
*/

/*
The best CSS property is clear:  .  Because clear:both; solves so many problems that happen with the float. And allows for float to be usable in many cases.
